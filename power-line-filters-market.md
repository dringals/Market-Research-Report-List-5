<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Power Line Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Differential Mode Interference Current</li><li>Common Mode Interference Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Power line filters are used in electrical systems to suppress interference currents and improve system performance. The two main types of interference currents that power line filters address are differential mode interference current and common mode interference current. Differential mode interference current flows in opposite directions on two different conductors, while common mode interference current flows in the same direction on multiple conductors. Power line filters designed to target these specific types of interference currents help to reduce noise and improve the overall efficiency and reliability of electrical systems.</p></p>
