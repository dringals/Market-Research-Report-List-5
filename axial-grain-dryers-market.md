<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Axial Grain Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Plenum</li><li>Split Plenum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axial grain dryers can be categorized into two main types: single plenum and split plenum. In single plenum dryers, the heated air passes through the grain bed only once, providing a more straightforward and economical drying process. On the other hand, split plenum dryers have two separate chambers for the heated air to pass through, allowing for more precise control over the drying process and potentially faster drying times. Both types have their own advantages and are suitable for different grain drying requirements.</p></p>
