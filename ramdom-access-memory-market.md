<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ramdom Access Memory Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DRAM</li><li>ROM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Random Access Memory (RAM) market primarily consists of two main types: Dynamic RAM (DRAM) and Read-Only Memory (ROM). DRAM is widely used in computers and devices for temporary data storage due to its fast access speed and volatility, meaning it loses data when power is off. In contrast, ROM is non-volatile and retains data even when powered down, making it essential for permanent storage of firmware and system instructions. Both types play crucial roles in overall system performance and functionality.</p></p>
