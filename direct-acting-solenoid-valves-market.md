<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Direct-acting Solenoid Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Step-by-step direct-acting diaphragm structure</li><li>Direct acting piston structure</li><li>Direct motion diaphragm structure</li><li>Step-by-step piston structure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct-acting solenoid valves are available in four main types based on their structure: step-by-step direct-acting diaphragm structure, direct-acting piston structure, direct motion diaphragm structure, and step-by-step piston structure. The step-by-step direct-acting diaphragm structure involves a diaphragm that opens and closes the valve in small steps. The direct-acting piston structure uses a piston to regulate the flow of the valve. The direct motion diaphragm structure allows for a quicker response by eliminating the step-by-step movement. The step-by-step piston structure operates similarly to the diaphragm structure but uses a piston instead.</p></p>
