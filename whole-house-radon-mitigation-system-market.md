<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Whole-House Radon Mitigation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Soil Depressurization (Interior)</li><li>Active Soil Depressurization (Exterior)</li><li>Active Soil Depressurization (Slab)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Whole-house radon mitigation systems utilize different techniques to reduce radon gas levels in homes. Active Soil Depressurization (Interior) systems use fans to create a vacuum under the home, pulling radon gas from the soil before it can enter the house. Active Soil Depressurization (Exterior) systems vent radon gas outside the home through pipes installed on the exterior. Active Soil Depressurization (Slab) systems are installed beneath concrete slabs and draw radon gas out from under the foundation. Each type of system effectively reduces radon levels to create a healthier indoor environment.</p></p>
