<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Rate Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photoplethysmography Sensors.</li><li>Electrocardiography Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoplethysmography sensors are non-invasive devices that measure changes in blood volume in small vessels near the skin surface, providing an indication of heart rate and rhythm. These sensors are commonly found in wearable fitness trackers. Electrocardiography sensors, on the other hand, measure the electrical activity of the heart by detecting the electrical signals generated by the heart as it contracts. These sensors are more accurate in measuring heart rate and detecting cardiac abnormalities, and are commonly used in medical settings.</p></p>
