<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ventilator market is primarily divided into two types: non-invasive and invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators support breathing without requiring intubation, using face masks or nasal prongs, making them suitable for conditions like COPD and sleep apnea. Invasive ventilators, on the other hand, involve direct airway access through intubation, providing critical support for patients with severe respiratory failure or during major surgeries. Each type plays a vital role in healthcare, catering to different patient needs and clinical situations.</p></p>
