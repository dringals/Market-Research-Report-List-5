<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Drilling Rigs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top-Hammer</li><li>Down-the-Hole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface drilling rigs can be categorized into two main types based on the drilling method used: Top-Hammer and Down-the-Hole. Top-Hammer rigs are equipped with a hammer-like device mounted on top of the drill string, which delivers impact energy to the drill bit. This type of rig is most commonly used for smaller diameter drilling applications. On the other hand, Down-the-Hole rigs use a pneumatic hammer located at the bottom of the drill string to deliver impact energy directly to the drill bit, making them suitable for larger diameter drilling projects.</p></p>
