<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photonic crystal Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Index-Guiding Fibers</li><li>Photonic Bandgap (Air Guiding) Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Index-Guiding Fibers refer to photonic crystal fibers that guide light through a low-index core surrounded by high-index material, allowing for enhanced transmission properties. On the other hand, Photonic Bandgap (Air Guiding) Fibers utilize a periodic lattice structure to create a photonic bandgap that prohibits specific wavelengths from propagating through the fiber, leading to unique light guiding capabilities. Both types of fibers offer distinct advantages in terms of optical communication and device applications within the photonic crystal fiber market.</p></p>
