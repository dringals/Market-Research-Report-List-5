<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cell Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intracerebroventricular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stem cell therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) primarily involves two administration routes: intravenous and intracerebroventricular. Intravenous stem cell therapy delivers stem cells directly into the bloodstream, promoting systemic effects and potentially aiding in the repair of damaged neural tissue throughout the body. In contrast, intracerebroventricular administration involves injecting stem cells directly into the cerebral ventricles, targeting the central nervous system more effectively. This method may offer a higher concentration of therapeutic cells at the site of damage, potentially enhancing treatment outcomes.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Stem Cell Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS)</li><li>Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS)</li><li>Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS)</li><li>Progressive Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PRMS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stem cell therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) targets various forms, including Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), where treatment aims to reduce relapse frequency and disease progression. In Primary Progressive MS (PPMS), therapy focuses on slowing down ongoing deterioration. Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) treatment addresses the transition from relapsing forms to chronic progression. Progressive Relapsing MS (PRMS) seeks to manage both progressive symptoms and occasional relapses. Each form requires tailored approaches to leverage stem cells' potential for regeneration and neurological repair.</p></p>
