<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric Fans</li><li>Mechanical Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive cooling fans come in two main types: electric fans and mechanical fans. Electric fans are powered by electricity and can be controlled more precisely to adjust cooling levels as needed. They are also more energy efficient compared to mechanical fans. On the other hand, mechanical fans are driven by the engine through a belt and pulley system. They are simpler in design and are often used in older vehicles or heavy-duty applications where extra cooling power is needed. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different automotive applications.</p></p>
