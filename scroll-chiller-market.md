<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scroll Chiller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Cooled Scroll Chillers</li><li>Air-Cooled Scroll Chillers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Scroll chillers are commonly divided into two categories based on their cooling methods: water-cooled scroll chillers and air-cooled scroll chillers. Water-cooled scroll chillers use a water source to remove heat from the system, while air-cooled scroll chillers use ambient air to cool down the refrigerant. Water-cooled scroll chillers are typically more energy efficient and quieter, making them ideal for indoor applications where noise level is a concern. On the other hand, air-cooled scroll chillers are easier to install and maintain, making them suitable for outdoor or open spaces.</p></p>
