<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electronic Scanning</li><li>Sector Scanning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing Machines come in two main types: Electronic Scanning and Sector Scanning. Electronic Scanning machines use a group of piezoelectric elements to electronically steer and focus the ultrasonic beams. This allows for quick and precise inspection of complex geometries. Sector Scanning machines use a single element transducer that mechanically scans a sector of the sample, providing a cost-effective solution for simpler inspections. Both types offer efficient and accurate testing capabilities for a wide range of applications.</p></p>
