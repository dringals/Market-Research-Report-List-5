<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spinal Fusion</li><li>Non-fusion Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spinal devices market can be categorized into two main types: Spinal Fusion and Non-fusion Products. Spinal Fusion involves joining two or more vertebrae together using bone grafts, screws, and rods to stabilize the spine. Non-fusion Products, on the other hand, include artificial discs, dynamic stabilization devices, and interspinous process spacers which aim to restore normal spine function without fusing the vertebrae. Both segments of the market play a crucial role in treating spinal disorders and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
