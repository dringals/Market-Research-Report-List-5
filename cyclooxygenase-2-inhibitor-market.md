<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li><li>Non-Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors are a type of medication that target an enzyme involved in inflammation and pain. There are two main types of Cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors: Selective Cox 2 Inhibitors and Non-Selective Cox 2 Inhibitors. Selective Cox 2 Inhibitors specifically target the enzyme responsible for inflammation, while Non-Selective Cox 2 Inhibitors affect other enzymes in addition to the target enzyme. Both types of inhibitors are used to reduce pain and inflammation, but Selective Cox 2 Inhibitors may have a lower risk of side effects.</p></p>
