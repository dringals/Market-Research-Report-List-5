<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coolant Temperature Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-Wire Coolant Temperature Sensors</li><li>1-Wire Coolant Temperature Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>2-Wire Coolant Temperature Sensors are designed with two wires for connecting to the vehicle's electrical system. They provide more accurate readings of the coolant temperature and are more reliable compared to 1-Wire Coolant Temperature Sensors. On the other hand, 1-Wire Coolant Temperature Sensors have only one wire for connection, making them simpler in design and installation. However, they may not provide as precise readings as 2-Wire sensors. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in regulating engine temperature and preventing overheating in vehicles.</p></p>
